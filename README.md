📌 Description

Tree Game is an interactive command-line Python game where the player must correctly build a number tree based on logical rules. The game generates a random root number and challenges the user to place numbers in the correct positions to complete the tree.

🎮 How It Works

The program generates a random number (root of the tree).

The player inputs numbers for different tree positions.

Each input is checked against logical conditions.

The game gives feedback (Correct / No).

At the end, the completed tree is displayed.
